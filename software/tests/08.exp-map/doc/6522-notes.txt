Behaviour for reading the IRs is as follows:

If you read a pin on IRA and input latching is disabled for port A, then you
will simply read the current state of the corresponding PA pin, regardless of
whether that pin is set to be an input or an output.

If you read a pin on IRA and input latching is enabled for port A, then you
will read the actual IRA, which is the last value that was latched into IRA.

If you read a pin on IRB and the pin is set to be an input (with latching
disabled), then you will read the current state of the corresponding PB pin.

If you read a pin on IRB and the pin is set to be an input (with latching
enabled), then you will read the actual IRB.

If you read a pin on IRB and the pin is set to be an output, then you will
actually read ORB, which contains the last value that was written to port B.

Writing to a pin which is set to be an input will change the OR for that pin,
but the state of the pin itself will not change as long as the DDR dictates
that it is an input.
